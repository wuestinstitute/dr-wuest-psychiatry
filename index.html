        <p>
          <b>Welcome to the Wuest Institute for Personalized Psychiatry &amp; Medicine.</b><br/>
          I'm Dr. Jessica Wuest, DO,
          a board-certified adult psychiatrist providing thoughtful, in-depth, and multi-modal mental health treatment for adults across <b>Virginia and Michigan with plan to expand to Illinois (2026)</b>.
          As a psychiatrist, I specialize in <b>trauma and stress-related conditions, depression, anxiety, psychiatric evaluation, medication management, sleep issues, OCD, bipolar spectrum disorders, and psychosis</b>, and the complex ways emotional and physical health influence one another.<br>
          If you're looking for an experienced mental health physician, I am welcoming new patients in both states.

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I believe we are all doing our best to navigate the complexities of life. My goal is to help you gain <b>agency, empowerment, and freedom</b>, while increasing <b>awareness, understanding, and the capacity to transform the patterns</b> that shape your life.
          Every person’s journey is unique and cannot be rushed. 
          <b>Meaningful change happens when it comes from within</b>—and to understand how best to support you, I take the time to learn about your experiences, your goals, and the ways your body and mind carry your story.

        <h3>Intentional & Collaborative Care</h3>
        <p>
          My practice is intentionally structured around <b>time, depth, and collaboration</b>. Sessions are longer than standard psychiatric visits, allowing space to understand your full experience—your history, nervous system, relationships, health, daily habits, and the patterns that shape how you feel.<br/><br/>
          <b>Appointments:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial intake: <b>60 minutes</b></li>
            <li>Medication follow-up: <b>30-60 minutes</b></li>
            <li>Therapy sessions: <b>30–60 minutes</b></li>
          </ul>
          This pace ensures we can develop a treatment plan that is <b>individualized, intentional, and grounded in your goals</b>. Your mental health deserves that level of attention.

        <h3>How I Work</h3>
        <p>
          I offer <b>multi-modal psychiatric treatment</b>, combining <b>evidence-based medication management and lifestyle change</b> with psychotherapy informed by <b>psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and insight-oriented approaches</b>.<br/>
          Training at the Chicago Psychoanalytic Institute has deepened my understanding of how past experiences shape present emotional life. <br/>
          My work is shaped by a <b>strong mind–body perspective</b>, with influences from training in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine, NADA auricular acupuncture, and over a decade of formal ballet and movement practice.<br/><br/>
          <i>Although I do not perform OMM or acupuncture virtually, this background informs how I understand posture, stress physiology, the autonomic nervous system, the somatic expression of emotions, and the ways the body carries lived experience.</i>
